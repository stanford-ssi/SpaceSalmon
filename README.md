# FishyFramework
This repo holds the embedded software for several of SSI's PCBs. It uses PlatformIO to build a number of frameworks and targets. [Tim Vrakas](https://github.com/Timvrakas) is currently the principal developer, reach out on [Slack](https://ssi-teams.slack.com/messages/timv) or by Email. 

## SpaceSalmon
[SpaceSalmon](https://wiki.stanfordssi.org/Space_Salmon) is a flight computer, designed by Tim Vrakas for the Stanford Student Space Initiative in 2018. Due to COVID-19, support for this hardware has not been well maintained.

## ThunderGuppy
[ThunderGuppy](https://wiki.stanfordssi.org/ThunderGuppy) is a hardware revision based on the SpaceSalmon architecture. It has similar hardware to SpaceSalmon, but is designed to fit in a 2" airframe. It is currently well supported.

## Quail
[Quail](https://ssi-wiki.stanford.edu/Quail) is an EGSE control system being developed in 2021 for SSI's liquid propulsion program. Significant software development will be needed to make use of the many hardware features.

### How To Setup The Build environment
* Install VSCode
* Add the extension Platform IO in the extension tab on the left
* Using git, clone the repo at https://github.com/stanford-ssi/SpaceSalmon.git 
* Open the repo in VSCode
* Use the check button in the bottom bar of the VSCode window to build
* Use the right arrow button next to the build button to upload

### Uploading
If BOSSAC uploading fails, use this:  
`python uf2conv.py -b 0x4000 .pio\build\XXX\firmware.bin`  

### Lessons Learned
* You can't write data into a buffer into another task, beacause you don't know that its constructor has been initialized! The main case is logging. Don't try logging from the constructors! We should probably prevent the logger from taking input before its initialized...
* Libraries work best when they don't export a bunch of header files. The internal header structure should use relative include paths, and careful attention should be paid to what headers end up in the project search path.
* Sometimes if you have too many static things, stuff goes very wrong. Particularly really big StrBuffers? idk.

### SHITL
The code supports SHITL (Some Hardware in the Loop) testing. This allows you to feed a log of sensor data from a past flight into the hardware in the place of live sensor data. To perform SHTIL you must do the following. The logs from a SHITL test are treated the same as flight logs.
* Enable the `sys.shitl` boolean flag, which will require you to rebuilding and reflash the firmware. The blinking pattern will be noticeably different than when running off sensor data. In SHITL mode, the reading of sensor data from the SD card will illuminate the Sensor LED.
* Place a `shitl.txt` file on the SD card. You may trim from both ends of a flight log to make the SHITL test faster.
Under SHITL, the system runs at ~180% speed, which is limited by SD access and CPU time. Sensor data is not re-logged, but filter data and flightPlan logs are printed for every data point provided.
After performing a SHITL, the output filter data should be compared to implementations in `sim/`, and the objectives of the flight plan should be verified (Test with real igniters!)
